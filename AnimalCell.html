<center><b>3-D PRINTED ANIMAL CELL PROJECT</b></h1></center>
<br><br><i><body><center>
For this project, I collaborated with the "Feelin' DNA" club at UNC Chapel Hill to model and 3-D print an animal cell for visually impaired, elementary-school aged children. I tried to vary the textures of each organelle so they would be distinguishable simply through touch. The model was designed in SolidWorks, and I was trained and certified by UNC Chapel-Hill to use a 3-D printer to complete the project.

A rim was added around the cell to represent the cell membrane. Extruded cylinders were added to distinguish the rough ER from the smooth ER. The rim and extrudes are large enough to be easily felt, providing a kinesthetically understandable experience.

The yellow stacked rectangles represent the centrioles. Smooth curves were added in the ribosome to differentiate between organelles.
