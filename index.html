The full frequency domain of the heartbeat ranges from .1-250Hz (Donnelly). There is a DC offset coming from the electrodes, so it would be necessary to eliminate this offset and higher frequencies with a filter. Therefore, it would be most practical to cascade a high pass and a low pass filter. First, a high pass filter could be used to filter out the DC offset. The resting heart beat is around 2-3Hz. Therefore, a high pass filter could be designed with a .5Hz stop frequency. This would eliminate minute interferences and the undesired DC input. The high pass filter could then have a 1Hz corner frequency to 250Hz corner frequency; the -3db pass band. Then, a low pass filter with a 250Hz corner frequency could be used to filter undesired high frequencies. 
The calculations for the filter are included at the end.
