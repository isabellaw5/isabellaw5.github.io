<h3> Who I am </h3>

Hello! My name is Isabella Watson. I'm a 22 year old student in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.
<br>
<h4>What I'm Up To</h4>

I'm a junior majoring in biomedical engineering through both UNC Chapel Hill and the College of Engineering at NC State. I transferred to UNC in fall 2016 after earning my Associate in Science degree from Forsyth Technical Community College with highest honors. I'm also completing a minor in mathematics. 
<br>
Outside of class, I work as a research intern for X2 Health, an initiative dedicated to improving women's healthcare in remote areas. 
<br>
<h5>Expertise</h5>

Most of my experience lies in electrical engineering, with a focus on medical application. Two recent projects include a functional pulse oximeter and EKG system, both built from scratch (for under $30!). The “My Work” tab will link you to demonstrations of the aforementioned projects and more.
<br><br>
I also have a strong background using 3D CAD design software, predominately SolidWorks, to create printable objects. I work as the head designer for a non-profit organization, "Feelin' DNA", at UNC. "Feelin' DNA" is predicated on the idea that blind students deserve equal access to a solid STEM education. With this non-profit, I 3D model and print scientific models for blind elementary school-aged students. Examples are listed under the "My Work" tab. 
<br><br>
During Fall semester 2017 I tackled my most challenging yet rewarding project: Designing, 3D printing, programming, and assembling a prosthetic arm for under $120. The prosthetic was commissioned by a real client and was customized as such.This project can be viewed under the "My Work" tab.
<br><br>
My work in electrical engineering has exposed me to the following: Hours of soldering, advanced laser-cutting, Adobe Illustrator design, 3D printing, microcontrollers, C and Python programming, Arduino, SolidWorks 3D CAD software, and more (see Resume).
<br><br>
 Though I am most familiar with electronics, I am always eager to learn about and practice different specialties: BME aptly prepares its students with skills transferable to all engineering fields. 
 <br><br>


<h6>Purpose</h6>

With the ultimate goal of solidfying a career in BME, 
I am looking for an internship.
 I am a passionate learner always ready to tackle new projects and challenges. 
 I have not yet decided my post-graduation focus, 
 as I feel I haven't had adequate exposure to the large breadth 
 of specialties within BME:  The opportunity to 
 work with a company/team to grow my engineering experience
 and knowledge of the field is exciting. I am quick to adapt to new situations and tasks, and thus am open to a position in any relevent engineering position.
