<h3> Who I am </h3>

Hello! My name is Isabella Watson. I'm a 23 year old student in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. I host and write the HTML/CSS for this website to showcase my engineering work!
<br>
<h4>What I'm Up To</h4>

Senior BS	Student	in	Biomedical	Engineering	at	The	University	of	North	Carolina	at	Chapel	Hill,	made Dean's	List	(2018),	specializing	in	electrical	engineering	and	robotics,	with	professional experience	as	a	senior	engineering	intern	at	X2	Health,	LLC	and	robotics	instructor	at	Stanford University. 
<br>
Outside of class, I work as a research intern for X2 Health, an initiative dedicated to improving women's healthcare in remote areas. 
<br>
<h5>Expertise</h5>

Most of my experience lies in electrical engineering and mechanics, with a focus on medical application. 
<br>
<br>
Through Helping Hands Club, I tackled my most challenging yet rewarding project; designing and assembling a 3D printed prosthetic arm for under $120 with a team of fellow undergrads. The prosthetic was commissioned by a real client and was customized as such. I plan to open source the files for others to use. See the final project at: http://bellawatson.me/Arm.html
<br><br>
My most recent project includes creating a mechanically-actuated prosthetic. I plan to streamline this design and partner with a non profit to disseminate the hand to victims of Syrian hospital bombings.See the "My Work" tab. 
<br><br>
I also have a strong background using 3D CAD design software, predominately SolidWorks, to create printable objects. I work as the head designer for a non-profit organization, "Feelin' DNA", at UNC. "Feelin' DNA" is predicated on the idea that blind students deserve equal access to a solid STEM education. With this non-profit, I 3D model and print scientific models for blind elementary and high school-aged students. Examples are listed under the "My Work" tab. 
<br><br>
Two recent projects include a functional pulse oximeter and EKG system, both built from scratch (for under $30!). The “My Work” tab will link you to demonstrations of the aforementioned projects and more.
<br><br>
My work in electrical engineering has exposed me to the following: Hours of soldering, advanced laser-cutting, Adobe Illustrator design, 3D printing, microcontrollers, C and Python programming, Arduino, SolidWorks 3D CAD software, and more (see Resume).
<br><br>
 Though I am most familiar with electronics, I am always eager to learn about and practice different specialties: BME aptly prepares its students with skills transferable to all engineering fields.
