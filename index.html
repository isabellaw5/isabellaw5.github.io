<h3> Who I am </h3>

Hello! My name is Isabella Watson. I'm a 23 year old student in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.
<br>
<h4>What I'm Up To</h4>

I'm a senior majoring in biomedical engineering through both UNC Chapel Hill and the College of Engineering at NC State. I transferred to UNC in fall 2016 after earning my Associate in Science degree from Forsyth Technical Community College with highest honors. I'm also completing a minor in mathematics. 
<br>
Outside of class, I work as a research intern for X2 Health, an initiative dedicated to improving women's healthcare in remote areas. 
<br>
<h5>Expertise</h5>

Most of my experience lies in electrical engineering, with a focus on medical application. 
<br>
<br>
Through Helping Hands Club, I tackled my most challenging yet rewarding project; designing and assembling a 3D printed prosthetic arm for under $120 with a team of fellow undergrads. The prosthetic was commissioned by a real client and will be customized as such. See the final project at: http://bellawatson.me/Arm.html
<br><br>

<br><br>
I also have a strong background using 3D CAD design software, predominately SolidWorks, to create printable objects. I work as the head designer for a non-profit organization, "Feelin' DNA", at UNC. "Feelin' DNA" is predicated on the idea that blind students deserve equal access to a solid STEM education. With this non-profit, I 3D model and print scientific models for blind elementary school-aged students. Examples are listed under the "My Work" tab. 
<br><br>
Two recent projects include a functional pulse oximeter and EKG system, both built from scratch (for under $30!). The “My Work” tab will link you to demonstrations of the aforementioned projects and more.
<br><br>
My work in electrical engineering has exposed me to the following: Hours of soldering, advanced laser-cutting, Adobe Illustrator design, 3D printing, microcontrollers, C and Python programming, Arduino, SolidWorks 3D CAD software, and more (see Resume).
<br><br>
 Though I am most familiar with electronics, I am always eager to learn about and practice different specialties: BME aptly prepares its students with skills transferable to all engineering fields.
