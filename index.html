<h3> Who I am </h3>

Hello! My name is Isabella Watson. I host and write the HTML/CSS for this website to showcase my engineering work!
<br>
<h4>What I'm Up To</h4>

Recent graduate with my BS	Student	in	Biomedical	Engineering	from	The	University	of	North	Carolina	at	Chapel	Hill,	made Dean's	List	(2018),	specializing	in	electrical	engineering	and	robotics,	with	professional experience	as	a	senior	engineering	intern	at	X2	Health,	LLC	and	robotics	instructor	at	Stanford University. 
<br>
Outside of class, I work as a research intern for X2 Health, an initiative dedicated to improving women's healthcare in remote areas. 
<br>
<h5>Expertise</h5>

Most of my experience lies in electrical engineering and mechanics, with a focus on medical application. 
<br>
<br>
Through Helping Hands Club, I tackled my most challenging yet rewarding project; designing and assembling a 3D printed prosthetic arm for under $120 with a team of fellow undergrads. The prosthetic was commissioned by a real client and was customized as such. I plan to open source the files for others to use. See the final project at: http://bellawatson.me/Arm.html
<br><br>
My most recent project includes creating a mechanically-actuated prosthetic. I plan to streamline this design and partner with a non profit to disseminate the hand to victims of Syrian hospital bombings.See the "My Work" tab. 
<br><br>
I also have a strong background using 3D CAD design software, predominately SolidWorks, to create printable objects. I work as the head designer for a non-profit organization, "Feelin' DNA", at UNC. "Feelin' DNA" is predicated on the idea that blind students deserve equal access to a solid STEM education. With this non-profit, I 3D model and print scientific models for blind elementary and high school-aged students. Examples are listed under the "My Work" tab. 
<br><br>
Two recent projects include a functional pulse oximeter and EKG system, both built from scratch (for under $30!). The “My Work” tab will link you to demonstrations of the aforementioned projects and more.
<br><br>
My work in electrical engineering has exposed me to the following: Hours of soldering, advanced laser-cutting, Adobe Illustrator design, 3D printing, microcontrollers, C and Python programming, Arduino, SolidWorks 3D CAD software, and more (see Resume).
<br><br>
 Though I am most familiar with electronics, I am always eager to learn about and practice different specialties: BME aptly prepares its students with skills transferable to all engineering fields.
